Used Car Price Prediction - SLR vs MLR vs Polynomial Method

Background
<p>I will develop several models that will predict the price of the car using the variables or features. This is just an estimate but should give us an objective idea of how much the car should cost.</p>

Some questions we want to ask in this module
<ul>
    <li>Do I know if the dealer is offering fair value for my trade-in?</li>
    <li>Do I know if I put a fair value on my car?</li>
</ul>


<p>A model will help us understand the exact relationship between different variables and how these variables are used to predict the result.</p>


**Data Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile

Result
<p>Comparing these three models, we conclude that <b>the MLR model is the best model</b> to be able to predict price from our dataset. This result makes sense since we have 27 variables in total and we know that more than one of those variables are potential predictors of the final car price.</p>
